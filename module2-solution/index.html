        <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Consider yourself as a student sitting in a classroom wherein your teacher is supervising you, “how you can solve the problem” or “whether you are doing correctly or not”. Likewise,
          in Supervised Learning input is provided as a labelled dataset, a model can learn from it to provide the result of the problem easily.
          Supervised Learning deals with two types of problem: classification problems and regression problems.
          <ul>
            <b>Classification</b>
            <li>Naive Bayes Classifier</li>
            <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
            <li>Logistic Regression</li><br>
            <b>Regression</b>
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Non-Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Bayesian Regression</li>

        <h2>Unupervised Learning</h2>
        <p>
          This learning algorithm is completely opposite to Supervised Learning. In short, there is no complete and clean labelled dataset in unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is self-organized learning.
          Its main aim is to explore the underlying patterns and predicts the output.
          Here we basically provide the machine with data and ask to look for hidden features and cluster the data in a way that makes sense.
          Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
          <ul>
            <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
            <li>Neural Networks</li>
            <li>Principal Component Analysis</li>
            <li>Apriori Algorithm</li>

        <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
        <p>
          It is neither based on supervised learning nor unsupervised learning. Moreover, here the algorithms learn to react to an environment on their own. It is rapidly growing and moreover producing a variety of
          learning algorithms. These algorithms are useful in the field of Robotics, Gaming etc.For a learning agent, there is always a start state and an end state. However, to reach the end state, there might be a different path. In Reinforcement Learning Problem
          an agent tries to manipulate the environment. The agent travels from one state to another. The agent gets the reward(appreciation)
          successbut will not receive any reward or appreciation on failure. In this way, the agent learns from the environment.
